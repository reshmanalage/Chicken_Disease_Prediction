# Chicken Disease Prediction (Coccidiosis Detection)

This project uses machine learning and image analysis to detect coccidiosis in chickens. By analyzing chicken fecal samples, it classifies the feces as either **healthy** or **diseased** (due to coccidiosis), enabling early detection and disease management in poultry farming.

## Project Overview

Coccidiosis is a common parasitic disease that affects poultry, caused by protozoa of the genus *Eimeria*. Early detection of coccidiosis is crucial to prevent outbreaks. This project leverages machine learning and image analysis techniques to predict the presence of coccidiosis in chicken feces.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow (or another ML framework)
- DVC (Data Version Control)
- Git

## How It Works
- The system uses images of chicken feces to detect visual patterns associated with healthy vs diseased feces.
- The images are processed using machine learning models trained on labeled datasets.
- A classifier is used to predict the disease status of the chicken.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Chicken_Disease_Prediction.git
   cd Chicken_Disease_Prediction
